            <p>The above code is a program that processes data from a csv file containing information about a college basketball tournament. The csv file contains data such as the region, ranks of the two teams playing, names of the teams, scores of the teams, the winning team, round number and game number. The program is written in C++ and has various functions that allow the user to choose from a menu of options to output different pieces of information from the data.</p>
            <!--addimage-->
            <p>The first part of the code defines a class called "bulls" which has private and public data types. The private data types include variables such as "Region", "Rank1", "Rank2", "Team1", "Team2", "WinningT", "Score1", "Score2", "Rnum", and "Gnum". The public data types include functions that act as getters and setters for these private variables. The getter functions allow the user to access the private variables and the setter functions allow the user to change the values of the private variables.</p>
            
            <p>The main function begins by declaring several variables that will be used throughout the program. The ALLDATA vector will store all of the data from the input file as a series of strings, and the ALLINFORMATION vector will store information about each game as bulls objects. The bulls class is defined earlier in the code and has both private and public member variables that store information about a game, such as the region in which it was played, the ranks of the two teams, the names of the two teams, the winning team, and the scores of the two teams.</p>
            
            <p>The main function then calls the menuIntroduction function, which prompts the user to enter the name of a file to read. This file is expected to be in the CSV (comma-separated values) format, with each line representing a game and the values in each line separated by commas. The main function also calls the readFile function, which reads the data from the file and stores it in the ALLDATA and ALLINFORMATION vectors. </p>

            <p>After the data has been read from the file, the main function enters a loop that runs until the user chooses to exit the program. Within this loop, the function calls the userChoice function to prompt the user to enter a menu option, and then uses a switch statement to execute the corresponding code for each option.</p>

            <p>The options available to the user include displaying information about all of the games in the file (option 1), displaying information about a specific game (option 2), searching for games based on various criteria (option 3), sorting the games based on various criteria (option 4), saving the data to a new file (option 5), adding new data to the file (option 6), and exiting the program (option 7).</p>

            <p>Overall, this program provides a convenient and user-friendly interface for storing, organizing, and analyzing data about sports games. It demonstrates the use of vectors, classes, and structs in C++, as well as the use of file input and output and menu-driven user interaction.</p>
